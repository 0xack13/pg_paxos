# pg_paxos

This PostgreSQL extension provides a basic implementation of the Paxos algorithm in PL/pgSQL and basic table replication through Paxos. It is in a very early stage, consider it primarily for educational purposes. 

pg_paxos can be used to replicate a table across multiple PostgreSQL servers. Every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on a replicated table is logged through Paxos. When a query is performed on the table, pg_paxos first ensures that all preceding queries in the Paxos log have been applied, providing strong consistency. By using the Paxos algorithm, pg_paxos is also robust to failure of a minority of nodes (e.g. 2 out of 5). 

## Installation

The easiest way to install pg_paxos is to build the sources from GitHub.

    git clone https://github.com/citusdata/pg_paxos.git
    cd pg_paxos
    PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make
    sudo PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make install

pg_paxos requires the dblink extension to be installed. After installing both extensions run:

    -- run via psql on each node:
    CREATE EXTENSION dblink;
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_paxos;
    
To do table replication, pg_paxos uses PostgreSQL's executor hooks to log SQL queries performed by the user in the Paxos log. To activate executor hooks, add pg_paxos to the shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf and restart postgres. It is also advisable to specify a unique node_id, which is needed to guarantee consistency in certain scenarios.

    # in postgresql.conf
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_paxos'
    pg_paxos.node_id = '<some-unique-name>'

## Using Paxos UDFs
    
The following query appends value 'primary = ip-10-11-204-31.ec2.internal' to the Multi-Paxos log for the group ha_postgres:

    SELECT * FROM paxos_append(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1247',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    proposed_value := 'primary = ip-10-11-204-31.ec2.internal');

current_proposer_id is a value that should be unique across the cluster for the given group and round. This is mainly used to determine which proposal was accepted when two proposers propose the same value.

The latest value in the Paxos log can be retrieved using:

    SELECT * FROM paxos(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1248',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    current_round_num := paxos_max_group_round('ha_postgres'));

## Using Table Replication

pg_paxos allows you to replicate a table across a group of servers. When a table is marked as replicated, pg_paxos intercepts all SQL queries on that table via the executor hooks and appends them to the Paxos log. Before a query is performed, preceding SQL queries in the log are executed to bring the table up-to-date. From the perspective of the user, the table always appears consistent, even though the physical representation of the table on disk may be behind before the read.

An example of setting up a replicated table on 3 servers that run on the same host (ports 5432, 9700, 9701) is given below. After adding the metadata on *all nodes*, all writes to the coordinates table are replicated to the other nodes.

    CREATE TABLE coordinates (
        x int,
        y int
    );

    INSERT INTO pgp_metadata.group (group_id) VALUES ('mokka');
    INSERT INTO pgp_metadata.host VALUES ('mokka', '127.0.0.1', 5432, 0);
    INSERT INTO pgp_metadata.host VALUES ('mokka', '127.0.0.1', 9700, 0);
    INSERT INTO pgp_metadata.host VALUES ('mokka', '127.0.0.1', 9701, 0);
    INSERT INTO pgp_metadata.replicated_tables VALUES ('coordinates','mokka');
    
An example of how pg_paxos replicates the metadata:

    [marco@marco-desktop pg_paxos]$ psql
    psql (9.4.4)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (1,1);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (2,2);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# SELECT * FROM coordinates ;
     x | y
    ---+---
     1 | 1
     2 | 2
    (2 rows)
    
    postgres=# \q
    [marco@marco-desktop pg_paxos]$ psql -p 9700
    psql (9.4.4)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# SELECT * FROM coordinates ;
    NOTICE:  Executing: INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (1,1);
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT paxos_apply_log($1,$2,$3)"
    NOTICE:  Executing: INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (2,2);
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT paxos_apply_log($1,$2,$3)"
     x | y
    ---+---
     1 | 1
     2 | 2
    (2 rows)
    
    postgres=# UPDATE coordinates SET x = x * 10;
    UPDATE 2
    postgres=# \q
    [marco@marco-desktop pg_paxos]$ psql -p 9701
    psql (9.4.4)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    postgres=# SELECT * FROM coordinates ;
    NOTICE:  Executing: INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (1,1);
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT paxos_apply_log($1,$2,$3)"
    NOTICE:  Executing: INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (2,2);
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT paxos_apply_log($1,$2,$3)"
    NOTICE:  Executing: UPDATE coordinates SET x = x * 10;
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT paxos_apply_log($1,$2,$3)"
     x  | y
    ----+---
     10 | 1
     20 | 2
    (2 rows)


## Advanced Table Replication UDFs

When using pg_paxos for table replication, items in the log are all SQL queries. This property can also be used to perform membership changes.

To add a new host to a Paxos group, run the paxos_add_host function on one of the existing members. The paxos_add_host function logs a query that updates the membership table on all nodes and returns the round number in which the query was logged. Any call to paxos for a higher round will include the host in the group.

    SELECT paxos_add_host(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1249',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    hostname := '10.35.209.23',
                    port := 5432);

To remove a host from the Paxos group, run the paxos_remove_host command on one of the existing members. The function works in a similar way to paxos_add_host.

    SELECT paxos_remove_host(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1250',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    hostname := '10.35.209.23',
                    port := 5432);

The paxos_apply_log function executes all SQL queries in the log for a given group  that have not yet been executed up to and including round number max_round_num:

    SELECT * FROM paxos_apply_log(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1251',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    max_round_num := 3);

The paxos_apply_and_append function appends a SQL query to the log after ensuring that all queries that will preceed it in the log have been executed:

    SELECT * FROM paxos_apply_and_append(
                    current_proposer_id := 'node-a/1252',
                    current_group_id := 'ha_postgres',
                    proposed_value := 'INSERT INTO coordinates VALUES (3,3)');
